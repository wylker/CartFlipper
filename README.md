# CartFlipper

This mod will check the target under your cursor and if it is a cart that needs flipped it will flip it.

The key to activate the mod is 'O' by default but can be changed in the config file.
By default the mod will attempt to flip a cart 3 times before it gives up.

* Warning: if you set this number high and the cart is truely stuck bad things may happen.

Currently the mod enforces a version check with the server.
